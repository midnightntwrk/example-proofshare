# example-proofshare

A privacy-focused smart contract and dApp prototype demonstrating selective disclosure of personal data using Midnight Network.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world scenario where individuals or families can selectively disclose only the necessary parts of their personal or dependent data—such as for signing up for daycare, applying for a job, or registering at a new clinic—while keeping all other information private.

It demonstrates a core concept of **selective disclosure** using a zero-knowledge pattern, where the data owner proves something about their data (e.g., “this person is over 18 and has valid insurance”) without revealing the data itself unless explicitly required.

## What Is Selective Disclosure?

[Selective disclosure](https://docs.midnight.network/blog/web3-intro-selective-disclosure) is a privacy-preserving method where a user proves facts about their data without sharing all of it. This is especially powerful for sensitive applications like:

- Medical or school forms
- Rental applications
- Government ID renewals
- Employment onboarding

This dApp currently simulates that process using a mocked smart contract and off-chain logic in TypeScript.

## File Structure


`├── README.md └── selective-disclosure.ts`

- `example-smart-contract.ts`: TypeScript file that contains the entire logic for the dApp, including mock data, disclosure circuits, and use case examples.

### About `example-smart-contract.ts`

The `example-smart-contract.ts` file is a **mock smart contract** written in TypeScript. It’s designed as an educational tool to demonstrate what a smart contract _could_ look like before transitioning into a real implementation in Compact on the Midnight Network.

It follows smart contract patterns such as:

- Ledgers: storing user data
- Constructors: initializing that data
- Circuits: simulating verification and selective disclosure logic
- Off-chain logic: to perform the actual work while maintaining privacy boundaries

This is _not_ a deployable contract but a helpful step in understanding what your Compact contract will eventually do and how your dApp logic might call it.

### Features
- Simulated smart contract structure with **ledger**, **constructor**, and **circuits**
- Off-chain logic that performs **selective disclosure** from obfuscated personal data
- Mock dataset of a fictional user ("Riley") with dozens of personal data fields
- Example disclosure requests for:
    - Doctor’s office
    - Job application
    - Rental application
    - School enrollment
    - Government ID renewal

### How It Works

1. **Personal Data Ledger**  
    Simulates an on-chain or private data store with obfuscated personal information.
2. **Constructor Function**  
    Loads user data into the ledger (in this mock, Riley's data).
3. **Selective Disclosure Circuit**  
    Accepts a request indicating which fields to disclose and returns only those fields as valid, obfuscated results.
4. **Off-Chain Logic**  
    Implements the core selective disclosure functionality. Mimics the behavior of a zero-knowledge proof without full cryptographic infrastructure.
5. **Use Case Examples**  
    Simulate different real-world data requests by customizing disclosure profiles for various service providers.


## Concepts Demonstrated

- Privacy-first data architecture: Inspired by real-world needs to minimize oversharing of sensitive data.
- Smart contract patterning: Simulates how data can be verified and validated without exposure.
- User-centric disclosure: Data owner remains in control at all times.

## Example Use Case: Doctor's Office

Instead of filling out a full medical history form, the user can choose to share just the relevant fields:

```
doctorDisclosureRequest[PersonalData.name] = true; doctorDisclosureRequest[PersonalData.age] = true; doctorDisclosureRequest[PersonalData.healthRecords] = true;
```
This keeps everything else—like social security number, address, or employment history—hidden and safe.

## Future Work

This mock serves as a stepping stone toward a full dApp using Midnight's privacy-preserving stack. Future enhancements will include:

- Writing a functional actual smart contract using Compact
- Integrating real zero-knowledge proofs
- Adding a front-end UI for user interaction and data requests
- Implementing APIs or a storage layer for private off-chain data management

## Built With
